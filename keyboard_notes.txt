Keyboard optimization:
	-movement type
		lateral
		vertical
		diagonal
		
	-finger distance traveled 
		(derived from physical keyboard distances)
		equivalent to keystrokes
		deviation from home row
			finger travel

	-hand usage
		alternating vs. same hand utilization (SHU)
			low SHU – high alternation
				not necessary for modern keys (?)
			hand stroke – key combination that can be done with one hand
		influence of dominate hand (?)
		balance vs. unbalanced usage
		
	-key locations
		middle columns
			finger columns
		home row
		top row
		bottom row
		number row
		
	-finger usage
		same finger utilization (SFU)
			use same finger to type separate keys twice in a row
		relative finger strength
			pinky vs pointer finger
		natural range of motion
		individual finger usage percentages
	
	-key values	
		bigram frequency (proximity of placement correlates with desirability of movement)
			-occurrence in daily keyboard usage
			-how often movement occurs
		capitalization, key combinations

Misc:
	typing out major books as a layout comparison test ...not representative?
	Comparison for other keyboard layouts
	Find a way to ease the transition
		-training program
		-transition in loops, by hand
	make layout portable
	influence of QWERTY familiarly on muscle development and muscle memory
		frequency leads to stronger development?
	Layout editor accessible by user for keyboard tweaking
	one handed... with a toggle on one side?

Guiding principles:
	-more frequently used keys for stronger fingers?
		-optimize favorite fingers, minimize weaker fingers
	-common bigrams should be prioritized
	-track number of key deviations from QWERTY (effect on learning curve, ease transition)
	-accuracy, effort, speed, ergonomics, distance
	-weight key stroke by finger/key
	-finger curling

Research:
Hand ergonomics
Hand motion/structure
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Finger strength (tensile?)
Digraph frequencies, motion capture
Quadratic assignment problem, flow matrix
